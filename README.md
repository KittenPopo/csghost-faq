# CSGhost FAQ
### Answers to common questions about my injector, CSGhost.

### What is CSGhost?
CSGhost is an injector program for CSGO cheating. It restarts your Steam with a VAC bypass module, preventing you from getting a VAC ban. It then allows you to inject a cheat of your choice into CSGO. **CSGhost is not a cheat on its own.**

### Why is my game crashing?
If your game crashes, it’s because of the cheat you injected, not CSGhost.
**Do not report “game crashing” as a CSGhost bug**, blame the cheat DLL you injected.

### When will it be patched or detected?
Maybe never. Valve does not seem to care about detecting VAC bypasses. 
CSGhost v4.0 with a full VAC bypass has been **undetected since April 2021.**

### "I got VAC banned using CSGhost!"
There are 3 possibilities:
- VAC marked you for ban when you were NOT using CSGhost, but the actual ban was delayed. VAC often delays bans by as much as 2 weeks.
- You were not VAC banned, but rather banned by overwatch or untrusted.
- You somehow managed to break CSGhost and mess up the VAC bypass. If you fully restart Steam AFTER starting CSGhost, the VAC bypass will no longer be active and CSGhost will tell you.

###Why is my trust factor red now?
Some CSGhost users may have their trust factor decrease after using CSGhost. 
This can be from a cheat you injected, or it can be the VAC bypass, which sometimes causes VAC to get concerned and lower your trust factor.
Your trust factor should recover after you stop using CSGhost.
